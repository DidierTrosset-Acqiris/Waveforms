Waveforms: Digitizer recordings processing library
==================================================

Waveforms is a Python module enabling digitizer's waveforms analysis,
filtering, serializing and imaging. Its high-level API is designed to enable
complex processing on multiple records, multiple channels digitizer data,
either live or recorded.

Use cases
=========

* Storing waveforms recorded from multiple digitizer channels.
* Calculating whole recording or sliding sine fits on waveforms.
* Calculating and plotting channel-to-channel skews.
* Reading previously stored recordings to apply new filters.
